It is a food recipe guide.
I have used React Native and JavaScript in making of this app.
This can work on both platforms IOS and Android.
I have used stack tab drawer navigation (React Navigation) for navigating through different screens. 
I have also added a filter (Veg, Non-Veg, Gluten free, Lactose Free) feature to inhance the experience. 
To update and manage the data seamlessly in between the different states I have used redux. 
In addition, I have also made a favorite section  to mark your Favorite dish.
